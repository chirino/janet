<h2>General Information</h2>

Java Native Extensions (JANET) is a programming tool simplifying integration of
native code with Java applications. A foundation for such integration is provided
by the Java Native Interface (JNI) API. However, that low-level API exhibits bare
bones of the Java Virtual Machine, and as such it is very inconvenient to use
and error-prone. JANET simplifies development process by defining
a lightweight Java language extension enabling work on a much
higher level of abstraction, closer to that of the Java language itself.
JANET translation tool is used to generate ordinary JNI code out of
JANET source files.
Detailed project info and documentation can be found at the
<a href="http://www.icsr.agh.edu.pl/janet">project home page</a>.
Please also see <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for
installation and usage instructions.

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>
JANET is a free, open source tool distributed according to the
terms of the <a href="license.html">MPL/LGPL/GPL tri-license</a>.
You may freely use, modify, and redistribute JANET, as long as you
retain the same license or use one of LGPL or GPL.
You may <em>not</em> sell JANET or include it in closed-source projects
unless you obtain separate license.
</p>

<p>
Unlike JANET core, however, files generated by JANET translator as well
as the utility classes are not covered by the open source license.
You have a great deal of freedom regarding the use of that files, including
the right to sell them, distribute them under the license of your choice,
and make them closed-source. The only requirement is that you mention in the
documentation of your project that the JANET tool was used to aid
the development. Detailed licensing information is included at the
beginning of each file.
